        <p class="lead mb-4"> More about myself, I spent my entire life in the 626 area of Southern California. I am accustomed to the unbearable heat in the summer and the disappointment as no snow ever falls in the winter. For me, everything needs to have an explanation whether it be a simple yes or no or an actual five minute in-depth conversation. This is why I always valued and enjoyed math in high school since every answer has a solid reasoning behind it explained by formulas that were cultivated centuries ago. While the concepts rarely stuck with me at first during lectures, I enjoy the trial and error that naturally comes along with learning a new lesson in class. Learning from my mistakes is a core value of mine since I was young as it was heavily emphasized by my parents and grandparents whenever I felt like giving up. This is also why I thought so highly of my Honors PreCalculus teacher who highly encouraged high â€˜Aâ€™ students to help explain lessons to struggling students in the class during my junior year of high school. I immediately  jumped on the opportunity to help my classmates as part of following my core values. During extra time in class or during lunch, I was able to contribute to their better understanding of the course. I was exhilarated to be able to help and gradually, my advice even resonated with my friends in physics and computer science. Yet, my passion for math was stronger than the confinements of school hours which is why I began working at Kumon where I tutored students in math and English. From preschoolers to high school students, my responsibilities entailed assisting them with difficult concepts in order to pass their assessments. So in order to successfully do my job, I simultaneously learned Calculus AB at Kumon where I received helpful tips to explain the problem solving process.

        Hello, My name is Caitlyn Hang and I am currently attending UCR majoring in Pre-Business. I hope to graduate in three years with aspirations of declaring into Business Administration with a concentration in marketing. I have always been fascinated by Business and economics. During the pandemic, I watched as my parents were worried every day regarding the stock market and how the pandemic had a major impact on trade and business in general. Also being from Los Angeles, it is a place with a large population and business potential as a high tourist area with plenty of opportunities to achieve your business dreams. When relatives or job interviews ask me what I want to be in the future, it is always such a difficult question to answer since my response is so simple. I just want to be an office worker. I love stability in my life whether that comes from daily tasks or just having a clear routine that I can follow for class projects. Being an office worker eliminates the worries of unemployment or business start-up failure which would give me lots of worries and anxiety. I never considered myself to be a person who could achieve the impossible or create life-changing products. This is why I am very content with just being a contributor to an already successful company which I know will always have business and success for a long time. This idea also stemmed from my parents who work similar jobs. My mom has an office job which I always looked up to. It was not a flashy job but at least I knew how my mom could continue to provide a stable income for the family without too much stress from her actual job. A significant turning point in my life was during junior year of high school when after a car crash, my grandfather had to undergo brain surgery and the doctors concluded that continuous speech and physical therapy sessions were necessary and crucial for my grandfather to recover from his partial memory loss. With my parents having an 8-5 work schedule I was automatically deemed the caretaker of my grandfather for the majority of the day during my junior year since I was the oldest child in my family aside from my brother. 
<br><br>

        During high school, I had experience in working at Kumon which is a tutoring system for young children in reading and math subjects. I worked there for around one year to gain experience in the work force and to try to be financially independent from my parents in preparation for college. My job entitled grading endless packets of math and reading when I first started working. I have great organizational skills and conversation experience to help and explain to the kids why they got the questions wrong and how to help them while still allowing them to learn the concepts by themselves. Later, I was promoted to one on one teaching with little kids in the two subjects respectively. This was a major shift as I went from quietly grading to holding thirty minute conversations or in some cases one hour conversations if they were learning both subjects at the same time. I gained new experience with being patient with children as they learn something completely new and have not had time to be skilled at it like I am. Essentially, this opportunity had transpired into an unseemingly mutually beneficial situation as I solidified my understanding of the concepts while being able to continue my love for math. I then used my newfound knowledge from Kumon to provide a stronger peer helping experience as well as to improve my own math skills. Being able to use math in my everyday life only enabled me to be more engaged in my classes such as History of Architecture where math is a core component.
